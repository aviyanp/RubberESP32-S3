# RubberESP32-S3
A Rubber Ducky Devboard built around an ESP32-S3-WROOM-1U Module. I built this because I really wanted to make my first devboard and it seemed like the perfect time to do so! It took way too much work, and it costs ~$90 because of Standard PCBA for the ESP32-S3, so I think it'd be better to just buy the parts needed to solder it on by hand and learn all about SMD soldering! It's definitely a learning curve trying to figure out what goes where and how to not screw up your routing so bad that you have to reverse ~4+ hours of work. I'm eventually trying to make an all-in-one mainboard for a robot that would incorporate 4 custom-made motor drivers and an ESP32-S3 controlling it all, so this is the first step in that direction! For now, I wanted something that I can easily test out and use IRL, so I decided to make a rubber ducky! It was really freaking rage-inducing, but it was all good fun and I learned a lot from it all.
